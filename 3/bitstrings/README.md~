# Bit strings

Consider the following type to represent bit strings:
```ocaml
type bitstring = ZT | UT | Z of bitstring | U of bitstring;;
```
where `ZT` represents the string made by a single 0,
`UT` the string made by a single 1,
`Z s` the string made by a 0 followed by `s`, and
`U s` the string made by a 1 followed by `s`.
